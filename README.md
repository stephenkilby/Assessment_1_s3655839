</ul>
<h3>Education</h3>
	• Higher School Certificate (2002)<br>
	• Hospitality – Certificate III (2005)<br>
	• Accounting – Certificate IV (2007)<br>
	• Bachelor of Business (Supply Chain Management) – Currently Studying</p>

<h3>Interests</h3>
<p>I have a keen interest, bordering on obsession, in sport, having played both soccer and cricket. I watch as much sport as possible on the television. I have travelled to the United States of America on numerous occasions, holidaying at times that coincide with my favourite sports over there, including American Football, Ice Hockey and Basketball. I am someone who takes a keen interest in sports facts and history, so people usually do not argue with me about sports trivia and facts.</p>

<h2>Interest in Information Technology</h3>

<p>My interest in Information Technology (IT) to date, has mainly been as a user of systems, software and social media. I started to become interested in IT when I was in high school and was selected into a pilot program, where all classes were conducted using computers and other technology. Since I started working at BlueScope in 2010, most of my work has involved the use of computers and business mainframe programs. Due to my work at BlueScope, I have developed advanced Microsoft Excel skills and am recognised as a key user and advisor for a number of business reporting programs, including Salesforce and Cognos.</p>
<p>There are two main reasons why I chose to study at RMIT to complete my Bachelor of Business (Supply Chain Management). First, RMIT offered the degree as a part of an Open Universities correspondence course. This was important to me as I am a full-time employee and this allowed flexibility to deal with work, study and other interests. The second reason is that I had very good feedback about the course from work colleagues in the Supply Chain Department at BlueScope, with many of them graduates of this degree at RMIT.</p>
<p>My major is in Supply Chain Management, which is my area of interest for future employment. The studies I have undertaken to date have greatly assisted me understand the theory and concepts of supply chain management and other business functions including finance and procurement. From an IT perspective, I expect to gain knowledge about how systems work and how they can be used to assist me with my work.</p>

<h2>Ideal Job</h2>

<h3>Supply Planner</h3>

<p>The role of Supply Planner is an ideal job for myself. I see this as a progression along my chosen career path. This role includes sales and operations planning and forecasting, and the balancing of supply with the demand plan. It also has responsibility for inventory management strategy and processes, and the implementation of inventory management models, along with being a key liaison role linking with other business functions involved in the supply chain, including supply chain, logistics, sales and finance.</p>
<p>To be successful in the role, requires experience in supply chain planning, particularly in Materials Management, with knowledge of master scheduling, capacity planning and supply chain management principles. Experience is also required in importation, including detailed knowledge of international freight documentation and knowledge of international trade. The nature of the work requires strong personal computing skills, with experience in Microsoft Office applications. As the role is a key liaison point with people from other key business functions, the ability to communicate, build rapport and work with others to achieve business priorities is an essential skill.</p>
<p>Considering my knowledge, skills and experience, compared to those required for the position, I currently have most of the skills and attributes required for the role. I have worked in customer services at BlueScope, which required operations planning, sales operations, which included sales forecasting, and currently work in supply chain, where I develop customised service offers which are offered to the market. I also have strong personal computing skills, particularly in Microsoft Excel, developed through experience in sales forecasting. In an earlier sales forecast role, I was also involved in and developed sound knowledge of demand planning. To be able to competently carry out the supply planning role, I would need to gain more experience in supply chain planning and knowledge of master scheduling. However, my other roles have been complimentary to these, so development of these experience and knowledge is more progressive than developing from first principles.</p>
<p>The plan to make myself a realistic candidate for than supply planning role largely has two parts. The first is to complete the degree I am currently studying, this will increase my knowledge of the theories, concepts and principles of supply chain management. The second is to seek opportunities to develop the supply planning experience and knowledge of master scheduling that I need, to be considered a suitable candidate for this role. Obtaining these skills and knowledge is possible within BlueScope. At BlueScope we have career development processes and discussions which provide the opportunity to discuss, with your manager, your career goals and to develop plans to gain the skills required for those roles. I would use this process to develop these skills, with a knowledge that my manager would be supportive.</p>

<h2>Personal Profile</h2>

<p>I have completed three personality or learning style tests. They are the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) Test, Mumford and Honey Learning Style Questionnaire, and Big Five Personality Test.</p>
<p>The MBTI showed that I am an ISTJ personality type. “ISTJ indicates a person who is energized by time spent alone (Introverted), who focuses on facts and details rather than ideas and concepts (Sensing), who makes decisions based on logic and reason (Thinking) and who prefers to be planned and organized rather than spontaneous and flexible (Judging). ISTJs are sometimes referred to as Inspector personalities because of their focus on details and interest in doing things correctly” (Truity 2019, para. 3). The MBTI indicates a preferred style. So while it indicates how a person prefers to act or work, it does not mean that they are unable to behave differently in different circumstances.</p>
<p>The Mumford and Honey Learning Style Questionnaire indicates the main learning style of the participant, based on four categories, including pragmatist, reflector, activist, and theorist, with the highest score reflecting the main learning style. My responses to this questionnaire indicate my preferred style is as a Reflector. A Reflector learns by observing and thinking about what they have learnt, stands back and views experiences from different perspectives, then collects data and take time working towards appropriate conclusions (Mint Human Resources 2019).</p>
<p>The third test was the Big Five Personality Test. This test measures participants against five personality factors, including extroversion, emotional stability, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and intellect/imagination. These results show that I am more introverted than extroverted, I tend towards emotional stability and agreeableness, and openness to experience, measured in the intellect/imagination factor. However, interestingly with agreeableness and intellect/imagination, while the raw scores were above 50%, the percentile scores against other test participants were quite low. Conscientiousness is both the highest raw score and percentile score. This indicates that I am careful and diligent (Open Source Psychometrics Project 2019).</p>
<p>For myself, the test results largely confirm my view of myself. I see myself as conscientiousness, analytical and a person who works towards making sure information is accurate. I also prefer to base decisions on facts and data and tend to be one of the quieter people within a work group. I have in the past taken on leadership roles, including President of the local cricket club, but my preference is to be involved in detail work and support rather than lead. The outcomes of the test would seem to support this view.</p>
<p>In a team I tend to sit back and listen to and evaluate the ideas, information and the discussion, unless it is a matter of fact or a question of process. With facts or process, where I know what is correct, I can assert my knowledge and lead discussion or work. The test results make me conscious that to be able to fully contribute to the team, I need to be more forward in expressing my ideas and knowledge. In a team, I would also need to think more broadly in order to develop ideas beyond the logical or conventional.</p>
<p>If I was a leader forming a team, I would need to select people with different profiles to myself in order to generate energy within discussions and idea generation, particularly including people who are more conceptual and think more broadly than myself. People would obviously bring different technical skills as well. This would also help in getting work completed, as while I have preference towards detail and process, others will be more conceptual, complementing my attributes. The idea of building a team is to have people with different strengths who can add to the performance of the team overall.</p>
<p>Summary of the available results for each of these tests is included below.</p>

<h2>Project Idea</h2>

<h3>Customer Forecasting Portal</h3>

<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>This project is aimed at significant customers of manufacturers of physical goods. The manufacturers, as the supplier, will provide these customers with access to a Customer Forecasting Portal, giving them the ability to input their projected forecast demand for defined periods of time. The data collected through the Portal will then be extracted and uploaded to the supplier’s demand forecasting database, providing the supplier with more accurate data on the demand expected from their larger customers. The expectation is this input will assist to improve production scheduling and purchasing of raw materials, and see a reduction in forecast error rates.</p>

<h4>Motivation</h4>

<p>One of the more difficult functions within a business is accurate demand planning and obtaining credible data on forecast demand. This is particularly relevant for commodities where demand is seasonal and for many subject to international demand or import competition. According to Willemain et al. demand forecasting plays a key role in planning production, inventory and workforce, the absence of accurate forecasts severely hampers production efficiency (Ref forecasting intermittent … p. 529). The more accurate the forecast, the better suppliers are able to manage the supply of raw materials, manufacturing, inventory and cash flow. Ultimately the key goal is to be able to provide the customer with the product they require, when they require it. By improving the forecast data this aim will be more consistently achievable. In a study by Syntetos and Boylan regarding intermittent demand they found that “accuracy of the forecasts and their variability (sampling error of the mean) have equal importance in terms of service level achievement and/or inventory cost minimisation” (Ref – On the variance of intermittent … p. 546).</p>

<h4>Description</h4>

<p>The Customer Forecasting Portal will be an online portal, allowing significant customers the ability to provide to their suppliers with data on their demand forecasts for specified periods. The portal will then store the data and provide the ability to extract data from the portal storage area to the supplier’s demand forecasting models. Therefore, the portal needs to allow input of the data required for the demand planning models, in a manner that is consistent with the data included in the demand forecasting model.</p>
<p>The Customer Forecasting Portal will use Microsoft Dynamics 365 as its development and operating platform. Significant customers, who order large quantities or volumes of product, will be provided access to portal by their supplier and will have the ability to input their demand forecast data. The data required to be input by the customers will include demand forecasts for the following six months. The next two month forecasts will be used to refine previously submitted forecasts, which is logical given forecasts of expected are generally more accurate closer to the actual time. Forecasts for three to six months provide estimates of demand which assist in forecasting, however, forecasts models factor in greater variability in demand forecasts for later periods.</p>
<p>The data to be provided will include;<br>
•	Product<br>
•	Product Specification (this would be customised for different suppliers with a drop-down box for selection of available products)<br>
•	Product Code (automated number based on product specification)<br>
•	The expected Quantity or Volume<br>
•	Time Period (how many months out the expected products will be required)</p>
<p>The customer will input the data for each product they forecast will be required over the next six months. This data will be stored in Microsoft Dynamics 365 and available for extraction and use by the Demand Planners of the supplier.</p>
<p>A standard download file format in xls will be developed. This download will be consistent with the data format and naming conventions required for the demand forecasting models. This will allow ease of extraction and upload of information into the demand forecasting model.</p>
<p>This project does not include the development of a Demand Forecast Model. Such models are likely to be peculiar to each manufacturer, consistent with their internal processes and business systems.</p>

<h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>

<p>To establish the Portal, there are two processes. The first process is the online portal, which both the customers and suppliers can access. The second process is the database that will store the information input by the customers, which then provides data for the overall demand planning database of the supplier. To be able to achieve this, Microsoft Dynamics 365 will be used to create the portal and to store the data input by the customers. Data will then be extracted into Microsoft Excel files, and uploaded as part of the input into the Demand Planners Forecast Models, along with information the planners collect on other customers and the overall market. There is also basic technology requirement for a device that can access the internet, such as a personal computer or tablets. However, there are no specialised hardware requirements for this project.</p>

<h4>Skills Required</h4>

<p>The skills required include the ability to create the portal using Microsoft Dynamics 365 application software and the ability to use Microsoft Excel. It will also require skills, or access to skills, in demand planning to ensure that the information captured through the portal is consistent with the information in the demand forecasting models is relevant for the demand planners. Apart from the ability to be able to use these existing products, there is no need for skills in software development. Accessing or developing the skills to complete the project is very feasible, as information is readily available on the operation of these systems.</p>

<h4>Outcomes</h4>

<p>If this project is successful, the expected outcome is a reduction in forecast error rates. This will benefit both the supplier and the customer. The benefits to the supplier include a more accurate forecast demand, better management of inventory and a reduction in inventory costs, more accurate procurement of raw materials, and better production planning. For the customer, the benefit will be greater confidence in the ability of the supplier to provide the product that they order at the time required. This may also assist the customers with their own production and demand planning, having spent time in developing the forecast their supplier.</p>
