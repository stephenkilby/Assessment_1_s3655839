<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>I have a keen interest, bordering on obsession, in sport, having played both soccer and cricket. I watch as much sport as possible on the television. I have travelled to the United States of America on numerous occasions, holidaying at times that coincide with my favourite sports over there, including American Football, Ice Hockey and Basketball. I am someone who takes a keen interest in sports facts and history, so people usually do not argue with me about sports trivia and facts.</p>
